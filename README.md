# ArtLedgerAI

## Overview
ArtLedgerAI is an innovative application that leverages artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to authenticate and verify the provenance of artworks. Targeting the niche market of art collectors, galleries, and institutions, it ensures trust and transparency in art transactions by combining cutting-edge AI analysis with immutable blockchain records.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Authentication**: Utilizes advanced machine learning models to analyze artwork characteristics (e.g., brushstrokes, materials, and signatures) for authenticity verification.
- **Blockchain Provenance Tracking**: Records artwork ownership and history on a secure, tamper-proof blockchain ledger.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive platform for uploading artwork details, viewing authentication results, and accessing provenance records.
- **Secure and Transparent**: Ensures data integrity and trust through decentralized blockchain technology.
- **Scalable for Niche Markets**: Designed for art collectors, galleries, auction houses, and museums seeking reliable authentication.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- A blockchain node (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger) or access to a blockchain service (e.g., Infura)
- AI model dependencies (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Git

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/makalin/ArtLedgerAI.git
   cd ArtLedgerAI
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
4. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add blockchain API keys, AI model paths, and database credentials (see `.env.example`).
5. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. Run the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
1. **Upload Artwork**: Use the web interface to upload images and metadata of the artwork.
2. **AI Analysis**: The AI model processes the artwork for authenticity, comparing it against known patterns and datasets.
3. **Blockchain Recording**: Verified artworks are logged on the blockchain with a unique hash for provenance.
4. **View Provenance**: Access the artwork’s history, including ownership and authentication details, via the app.
5. **Share Certificates**: Generate and share digital authenticity certificates backed by blockchain.
